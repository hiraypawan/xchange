Implement Remote Code Loading (Full Jugaad Auto-Update System)

I want to implement Remote Code Loading for my Chrome extension so that:

✅ I never need to re-install the extension
✅ My users never need to reload the extension
✅ All logic updates instantly when I update the server
✅ Only the manifest + base files remain inside the extension
✅ All engagement logic (like/RT/follow), selectors, functions, and flows load remotely
🔧 Requirements:

Implement a system where:

1️⃣ The extension loads ALL core logic from a remote server

A single remote-loader.js file lives inside the extension

This file downloads the REAL logic from:
https://myserver.com/xchangee/extension-core.js

This remote file contains:

button selectors

action logic

engagement engine

click automation

retry logic

updated DOM handling

everything that changes often

Only the remote URL stays fixed inside the extension.

2️⃣ Built-in auto-update every time

The extension should:

Fetch the remote JS every time a Twitter page loads, OR

Fetch once and cache for 1 minutes

If the server JS changes → extension instantly uses new code

No need to reinstall extension EVER

No CRX updates needed

No Chrome Store needed

3️⃣ Safety checks required

Implement:

Try/catch around remote fetch

Fallback to cached version if server fails

Version header check:

server sends x-version

extension logs if version changed

Console logs for debugging

No security-risk eval; use:

new Function(remoteCode)()
OR

import() with blob URL

4️⃣ Internal Structure

Inside extension:

content-script.js
background.js
remote-loader.js   <-- loads external code
manifest.json


Inside server:

extension-core.js  <-- real logic ( engagement engine )
extension-selectors.js
extension-utils.js


The remote loader must import everything from the server.

5️⃣ Engagement Logic Movement

Move these into remote JS:

performLike()

performFollow()

performRetweet()

detectButtons()

clickWithVerification()

observer logic

dynamic selectors

fallback selectors

engagement pipeline

The extension’s local content script should ONLY:

Load remote code

Call remote initXchangeCore()

Handle message routing

6️⃣ Communication Flow

After remote code loads:

Background → Content → Remote code

Remote code logs its version

Remote code handles all actions

Remote code triggers ENGAGE_RESULT

Tab closes after success

7️⃣ No Manifest Changes Required

All logic changes happen on server, not the extension.

8️⃣ Deliverables

Give me:

Correct architecture

Dummy remote-core template

remote-loader integration logic

How to fetch + cache + fallback

How to structure remote updates

How to log version and errors

How to test the system

Security best practices

Example implementation

Explanation of how this bypasses Chrome Store update limitations safely

🎯 Goal

Create a Chrome extension where ALL logic lives on my server,
and the browser automatically uses the newest version with ZERO user effort.
